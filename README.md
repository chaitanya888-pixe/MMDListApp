## Architecture

The app follows a **modular architecture pattern** with the following main modules:

- **core**:  
  Contains shared resources and configurations essential for the app.

- **data**:  
  Responsible for managing data sources, including local storage, remote APIs, and caching.

- **domain**:  
  Manages the appâ€™s business logic, including use cases and entities.

- **presentation**:  
  Handles the UI using Jetpack Compose to render views and manage user interactions.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for modern and declarative UI development.
- **Retrofit**: For seamless API integration.
- **Clean Architecture**: 
  - Separation of concerns across Presentation, Domain, and Data layers.
  - Enhanced reusability, testability, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection**: 
  - Efficient management of modules and initialization of dependencies.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Covers empty, data, and error scenarios for robust implementation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Architecture Overview**
   - **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI and user interaction.
   - **Domain Layer**: Includes use cases and business logic.
   - **Data Layer**: Manages API calls and data repository.

### 2. **UI Implementation**
   - List of articles displayed using Jetpack Compose.
   - Detail screen to show complete information about a selected article.

### 3. **Error Handling**
   - Manages empty, error, and successful data states with appropriate UI feedback.

### 4. **Dependency Injection**

  - Implemented using modules to simplify dependency management and testing.
